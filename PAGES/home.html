<h4 class="flex justify-center p-4 font-bold">About the Department :</h4>
<p class="p-6">
    The Department of Computer Science was established in the year 2009.
    Initially the department offered Integrated Msater of Science in Computer
    Applications and IT. The department started three new programs M.Sc. (IT),
    MCA and PGDCA in the year 2011. The Department also provides M.Sc
    (CA-IT),B.S.c(CS) and PhD in Computer Science . It has consistently
    fulfilled its role of producing Computer Engineers ready to satisfy the
    needs of the IT world. It has a well qualified and experienced faculty team.
    The department has adequate facilities to support these teaching activities.
    As computers become obsolete fast, it is necessary to continuously upgrade
    the facilities. Students of the department have sufficient high end
    computing facilities.
